My project is fully deployed and functional on AWS. The repository has the latest code, but does NOT have a commit for the actual deploy. Meaning, it has all the code but no www directory and no .elasticbeanstalk directory, I generated those after pushing my code to the remote repo.

Here is the link to the repository:
https://github.com/Sir-Veillance/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/project/image-filter-starter-code
It is a fork of the entire Udacity repo, but that link directly links to the relevant portion of the repo that I modified.

Here is the link to my deployed app:
bmckay-udacity-course2-project.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com

As per the specifications, you can choose a valid URL to a web-hosted image and pass it in as a query parameter to the filteredimage route to filter it. The image is deleted off local storage immediately after the response is sent.
